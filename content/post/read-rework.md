This is the book written by 37signals. Don’t know 37signals? It’s the small but fine team which builded the excellent Ruby on Rails. They are maybe the most fessional team in IT and many ideas are practial and suggestful. But to be honest, the book is soso. Many things everybody knows, just can’t accomplish.
