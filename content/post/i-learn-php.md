## Experience

In 2011, I start to know this guy, PHP. It wasn’t my first language for web programming at that time because I was studying J2ME for Android and J2EE for web. However, it got the chance when I felt upset for all the stuff about Servlet, Tomcat, JavaBean and so on. PHP is really a suitable language for website developing. And no matter you use Windows or Linux, you can easily install Wamp or Lamp to setup the environment. Moreover, each PHP file is a page, then learn some redirect skill you can build the complete website. Of course, you need to connect MySQL database and know about a little CSS, JavaScript and JQuery for better. That’s what I have learned but not proficient at all of them even now.

## Project

Maybe every beginner wants to build his or her blog system in PHP at first. I would like to do that but not complete actually. It’s easy to design the simple MySQL schema but not for productivity. That’s why so many people change to use WordPress instead of their own websites.

WordPress is really worthy to read it’s source code if you are studying website developing. It gave me another to develop in PHP, by implementing my WordPress theme. It was written in PHP, CSS and JavaScript and I was lazy to use Bootstrap. It’s quite easy and sounds professional.

Another chance to use PHP is when I was developing an Android application. I need a simple server to response the client requests and provide files to download. PHP is the most suitable tool I think. The function is simple, no performance considered and I could reuse my PHP server which is bought for this blog.

## Recommendation

PHP is a great programming language with no doubt. It’s especially suitable for developing a small or personal website. If you are a programmer, I highly recommend you to learn it. When you see your website appear in other’s web browser, you could be so exciting. And when you are interacting with the database, you may think, “ok, I’m able to do lots of things”.
