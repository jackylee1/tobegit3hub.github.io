### About School

School is the fucking place. Don’t expect what it can teach you, learn everything by yourself and know about this as soon as possible.

### Satisfy Everybody

Be aware that you can’t satisfy everybody. You can only make the ones you really care happy.

### Work Is Great

The first time I work as an intern, it’s the greatest experiment in my life. It may be hard but just compare with school, wow.

### Learn More

Maybe the more you learn, the shallower you touch. But anyway, you have to contact lots of things and try not to avoid them.

### Open Your Mind

Drop your principle and accept the facts even if they’re incomprehensible. You may see they are reasonable.

### Appreciate Somebody

Maybe you don’t have to learn it and when you get your girlfriend, it’s self-taught.

### Think Further

No need to think how to implement firstly. Figure out what you want then just think how you can achieve it.

### Tolerate Unfairness

It’s common, hardly avoid and almost impossible to change. Keep feeling uncomfortable and do what you can do now.

### Nothing Is Bad

You can’t experience all kinds of lives. Just keep it in mind that what I’m doing now is awesome as well.
