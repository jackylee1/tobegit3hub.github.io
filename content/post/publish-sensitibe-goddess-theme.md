What will be done:

* This theme is time-sensitive and the fundamental color will change from morning to night.
* About four style.css files for morning, noon, afternoon and night.
* A gallery to show all my pictures in the server.
* A time-line wall to show my microblog.
* Wow, invent the Comment Flow if possible.
* Add douban or sina events here, maybe.
* Remove the “About Me” page and put my information aside.
* Put the project posts together.
* May be released after Christmas or even Chinese New Year’s Day.
* Oh, goddess should NOT be ignored.
