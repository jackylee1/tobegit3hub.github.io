* It’s really hard to sample randomly.
* Now we focus on relationship, not cause.
* Big data uses all the data, not sample.
* Should accept the precision.
* Simple algorithm with big data is more effictive than complex one with \
classical data.
* They appreciate unprecision and not pretent to be precious.
* Only one truth is not real.
* Knowing what it’s is enough, not why it’s.
* It’s not the reason and it comes out a false relation.
* It’s hardly to comfirm causality relationship.
* Big data makes experience.
* Google should do something for extending GPS.
* Verification code is kind of automatic man-computer distinguish Turing \

* Data can be reused.

* The mind of big data is trying to use public data to solve ordinary pro\
blem.
* Providing APIs extends the value of data.
* IPhone also comes from big data.
* Google is controlled by engineers and use data as center.
* But apple use intuition more than data.
* Algorithm engineer is more and more important to discover the value of \
data.
* IT is more focus on information, not technology.
