## Abstract

This paper will not noly introduce the project SongStory, but also show you how it's developed. It could be helpful for us to know what we can do after learning programming and how to start a project. So we will take SongStory for example, progressively let you know everything about developing this program. 

The section one will introduce the overview of SongStory but not with technical details. The nennxt section will tell you why we choose to this topic and what we need to kickoff the project. Then the section three is about development details. This should be interesting because you can learn how to put your knowledge into practice, rather than just doing the computing exercise in text book. The next section will tell related work, such as project management and others. And the last one will give a general conclusion.

## 1 Introduction

SongStory is the Android project we developed in April 2013. If you're not interesting in Android programming, it's still worthy to read on because it includes knowlege about web programming and other skills. The project has been open source(Reference[1]). You can find SongStory, the client, SongStoryServer, two tool named SongStoryCreateSs and SongStoryWriteJson. It's mainly an Android application to listen to the music while reading the article related to the music, and we can it "tell the story behind the song". I can tell it's a brand-new experience. Most people like music but they don't know why it's so moving. What's more import is that we don't know the story of the song, and I can't see any platform provides the content for us. So we do it. By implementing SongStory, we provide the fantasy content and display anything related to the song on Android phone. You can try it by yourself and find the definite creativity and simplicity. The final program we made is satisified but the progress is more meaningful for you. We build the four-member team including three programmers and one designer, which is enough to complete a integral and meaning project for you. Okay, let's start with the preparation we always need to do.

## 2 Preparation

When you make up your mind to start a project, you definitively need to build the team. Sometimes you may think I'm enough and I don't need anybody. That's just for personal experiments but for a project you should ask designers and other programmmers for help. The best choice to find partners is ask your classmates. That's how the SongStory team does because we need each other and we're really familiar so that communication is not a problem. Anyway, if you want to build a graphic application that people might see, find a designer, especially a visual desiner. It's worthy to pay attention to the final effect, no matter how many functions you can perform. Because people care. So if you can find four or five people(including at lease one designer) to work for a project, you're so lucky and just do it without further ado. Too many member is suck because you need to communicate with others at any time and for ten people you always need a meeting room for trivial discussion. Brife suggestion: be more agile. When you get a team, the next topic is what you guys want to do. It would be great if someone figure out a convincing idea but most time we don't, so brainstorming is neccessary. I have organized a brainstorming and force each memeber to make up ten ideas before discussing, then we get tens of hundreds options and pick the best one we all aggreed. Clearly know why you want to use it and be aware of that choosing the topic is far-reaching. By the way, SongStory is the idea I made up and other members are fortunately excited about it. I deeply believe that's the power supports us to complete the project although the progress is toilsome and troublesome.

## 3 Development

If you're mean to implement your thought, I most recommand tools in advance. First you need to have the aggreement of using what kind of verson control tool. Git is the best choice but svn may be used more commonly, but all of these should be learned by yourself. To be honest, we don't use anyone of them. Beacuse other members have no conscious about version control and then you will find the inefficience of integrating code. Fortunately each of us developed the independent module but this is highly not recommonded. If you use git, you may also need a server. There are three ways to do that: setup gitlab or others in your computer, rent a server and put into github.
