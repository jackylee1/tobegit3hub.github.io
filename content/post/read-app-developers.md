It’s the book about the history of App Store and individual application developers. The first part tells the story how iPhone came out and what opportunities App Store gave. It’s really excited while reading this because I was in this period and witness what have changed at that time.

The book take Anger Birds, Doodle Jump and others for examples and let us know the whole processes of developing this apps. They are the lucky guys who become famous because of the evolution of software development, and we must clearly know that App Store is a large market but not all people can achieve their goals here. However, it gives us faith that individual developers also have chances nowadays. If we pay afford, we can have competition with anyone who get involved in this world.
