It’s a psychology book written by Chinese. In general, its content is informative and really lively. It’s the suitable book for ordinary people to know about psychology, like me and to understand the special thinking in the life.
Ok, I think it’s good for everybody to read it but don’t be so serious for rigorous professional knowledge.
