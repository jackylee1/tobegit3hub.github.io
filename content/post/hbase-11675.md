Check out [HBase-11675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11675) and here's the description:

<pre>
The bug mentioned in http://hbase.apache.org/book.html

5.9.2.2. Major compactions change query results
“...create three cell versions at t1, t2 and t3, with a maximum-versions setting of 2. So when getting all versions, only the values at t2 and t3 will be returned. But if you delete the version at t2 or t3, the one at t1 will appear again. Obviously, once a major compaction has run, such behavior will not be the case anymore...”
</pre>

This issue was closed as "won't fix" but it's still a problem. Because users should be care about major compactions which may return them different results. Now there's no efficient method to avoid it for the reason that the limitation of versions will not apply util compactions.

Can we just put a delete mark on the overdue values? It requires at most one more put for each put and seems inefficient.

Or can we improve the restriction of `get` to check the limitation of versions? We have to get the status of all the versions before that. Seems nice and I will work for it.
