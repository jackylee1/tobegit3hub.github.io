## Experience

Python is the programming language that refreshed my mind. I learned it in 2012 after I have learned C++, Java and PHP. Generally it’s introduced as a script language but the greatest changes are pythonic syntax and list comprehension. It was the first time for me to hear Convention Over Configuration and it’s the greatest experience to write codes without useless semicolon. List comprehension also refresh my programming thinking. With it, quick sort is implemented in three lines, which really, really shocked me. So it’s the adorable language for everybody and it’s useful for study or work as well. All the comments about were believed before I know about Ruby.

## Project

Many people learn Python to write crawler to automatically collect resources from Internet. For me, I have written some crawlers to collect blogs and download images. There are so many tutorials to teach the skills of writing crawler but unluckily not ultimate course. During developing SongStory, Python was the best choice for us to write simple tool for compressing and executing json files. And at work, most people write simple script to invoke other program and implement simple components like email alert. I have to and would like to learn Django to develop web application in Python framework.

## Recommend

Everybody should learn a script language, no matter you’re a programmer or not. And I think Python is the best choice to learn. You can learn programming beginning with Python because of it’s simple syntax and you can use it to process task for the reason that it has a large, general and well designed library. Ruby may be another choice but if you have to pick one, Python is always better, that’s why it’s so popular in the world
