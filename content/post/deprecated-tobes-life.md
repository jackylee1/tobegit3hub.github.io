## Introduction 

The days in Beijing should be colorful and meaningful. For the last two weeks, I was trying to cook, watch funny video and listen to the radio to aviod the classical dull life of programmers. It’s not enough when I saw the article in . If you don’t want to live tiredly, follow what you like and live like what you want.

## Study

Working is hard and spend most time, however, we had better manage it. Checking the mailbox should be the first thing when you switch on your monitors(I get two monitors and no-power-off computer). Then I think reading the news related to us is important as well. So go to or <36kr.com>. However, the IT information from foregin sources may be better. By the way, it’s time to improve your English so I ought to find some popular website for the global programmers. is suck now and don’t waste time to check its advertisement. You can go to but don’t spend much time for no purpose. Ok, I will give a list of these valuable webistes. Moreover, don’t be dull.

## Life

Cooking is good and I think I have made a right decision. You can make a meal when you want to eat something and not when you are over-sleeping or it’s raining. Keep your mind and cook something funny. It’s kind of a way to make the day different. Keep in touch with your girlfriend is happy, for both of you. The only thing I worried about is training. There are rare chances to have exercise especially in weekdays. Seeking a opportunity to run or do it in dormitary, I need to pick one. Anyway, the regular time for rest is really important and I will make the plan as soon as posible.

## Society

There is something I don’t want to mention. Because I don’t have much to put out. Just be open and everybody will appreciate it.
