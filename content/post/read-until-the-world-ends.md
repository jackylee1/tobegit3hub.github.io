This is the biography of Dan Lin who is the badminten champion at this age. He’s humble, skillful and hard-working. From the book I know more about his life, not only training, competition but also the love. It’s a little strange to look thought other people’s life, however, what I thinking about is that the greate person like him also has a ordinary life. It makes me start to think, no matter how hard we work, we can only live better but not shiny. Maybe that’s what we try to pursuit in heart.
